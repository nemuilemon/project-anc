# **Project A.N.C. (Alice Nexus Core) - Technical Specification**

## **1. Project Overview**

Project A.N.C. is a **Personal Knowledge Engine** designed to integrate and enhance user thoughts and knowledge through AI collaboration. More than just a note-taking application, it functions as a dedicated "second brain" for users, supporting intellectual productivity through an advanced desktop application.

## **2. Core Architecture**

The application employs a loosely-coupled three-tier architecture consisting of UI, Data Management, and AI System layers.

### **UI (User Interface)**
* Built with **Flet**, a Python framework enabling rapid desktop application development with cross-platform capabilities using pure Python code.

### **Data Management (Hybrid Model)**
* **Note Content**: Stored as plain text **Markdown files (.md)** directly in the file system for maximum portability.
* **Metadata**: File metadata (title, path, tags, etc.) stored in **TinyDB**, a lightweight NoSQL JSON database for fast querying.
* This hybrid approach ensures data portability while maintaining high-speed metadata operations.

#### **Database Schema**
TinyDB record structure for each file:
```json
{
    "title": "filename.md",
    "path": "C:\\notes\\filename.md", 
    "tags": ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"],
    "status": "active",
    "order_index": 1
}
```

**Field Descriptions:**
- `title`: Filename for display
- `path`: Absolute file path
- `tags`: Array of AI-generated or manually assigned tags
- `status`: File state (`"active"` or `"archived"`)  
- `order_index`: Display order (numeric, ascending)

**Legacy Support:**
Files without `status` or `order_index` default to `"active"` and `0` respectively.

### **AI System (Hybrid Brain)**
* Uses **Ollama** running locally as the "cerebellum" for AI operations.
* Analyzes note content via Ollama to extract keywords for **automated AI tagging**.

## **3. Technology Stack**

* **Programming Language**: **Python**
* **UI Framework**: **Flet**
* **Database**: **TinyDB** 
* **AI Integration**: **Ollama** (via `ollama` Python library)
* **Security**: **Enhanced input validation and path sanitization**
* **Performance**: **Asynchronous operations with progress tracking**
* **Logging**: **Comprehensive multi-category logging system**

* **`logger.py`** (~320 lines) - **[NEW IN PHASE 2]**  
    * **Comprehensive logging system** with multiple specialized categories.
    * Generates structured logs: app.log, file_operations.log, ui_events.log, errors.log, security.log, performance.log.
    * Includes `PerformanceTimer` context manager for operation timing.

* **`security.py`** (~250 lines) - **[NEW IN PHASE 1]**
    * **Security utilities** for input validation and sanitization.
    * Prevents path traversal attacks and filename injection vulnerabilities.
    * Provides safe file operations with comprehensive validation.

* **`config.py`**
    * **Configuration management** for application settings.
    * Centralizes paths, database names, AI model settings for maintainability.

## **5. Development Environment Setup**

### **Virtual Environment**
The project uses **Python virtual environment (.venv)** for dependency management:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux  
source .venv/bin/activate
```
