## Upgrade Guide

### Upgrading from v2.0 to v3.0

#### Breaking Changes

1. **Plugin Registration**

   ```python
   self.ai_manager.register_plugin(TaggingPlugin())
   ```
   - **New**: Automatic discovery (no code changes needed)
   ```python
   # Just place plugin in app/ai_analysis/plugins/
   # PluginManager discovers automatically
   ```

2. **State Management**
   - **Old**: Direct state manipulation
   ```python
   self.files[path] = metadata
   ```
   - **New**: Use AppState
   ```python
   app_state.add_file(path, metadata)
   ```

3. **UI Components**
   - **Old**: Custom UI code in each file
   - **New**: Import from ui_components
   ```python
   from app.ui_components import ProgressButton, ExpandableSection
   ```

#### Migration Steps

1. **Update Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
